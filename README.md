# GNNs-cox

Time to event prediction using Graph Neural Networs.

This is an extension of the [pycox tutorial with CNNs](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/havakv/pycox/blob/master/examples/04_mnist_dataloaders_cnn.ipynb) to make it work with graph neural networks. It works with [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai) library at the moment. The example uses randomly generated graphs.

The rest of the repo is work in progress, check soon for updates! :D
